Meetings of the Scientific Computing Group will be held once a week, 2:40--3:55 on Zoom. The meetings will usually be on Friday, but occasionally we will meet at other times. For specifics, see the schedule below. 

First year graduate students and undergraduates interested in applied math and scientific computing are welcome to attend. (A presentation is not required.)

For more information contact [Jim Nagy](http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~nagy), [Talea Mayo](https://www.taleamayo.com), [Lars Ruthotto](http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~lruthot), [Alessandro Veneziani](http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~ale), or [Yuanzhe Xi](http://www.math.emory.edu/~yxi26/).

For the fall 2020, the seminar switches to online meeting. The Zoom Meeting ID is https://emory.zoom.us/j/95900585494.
