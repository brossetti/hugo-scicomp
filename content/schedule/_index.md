Meetings of the Scientific Computing Group will be held once a week, 2:00--3:00 in W301. The meetings will usually be on Friday, but occasionally we will meet at other times. For specifics, see the schedule below. Entertainment will normally consist of a seminar talk.

First year graduate students and undergraduates interested in applied math and scientific computing are welcome to attend. (A presentation is not required.)
