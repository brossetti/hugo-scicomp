The Department of Mathematics at Emory University has multiple funded positions for undergraduate summer research in applied and computational mathematics. Topics include machine learning, inverse problems, linear algebra, and partial differential equations. The students will be hosted on Emory's main campus in Atlanta, GA, for eight weeks during the summer. Students are expected to start on June 3. Participants will work independently on a research project under the guidance of the local faculty mentors. 

Summer 2019 projects are being developed in the areas (a) deep neural networks modeled by partial differential equations (b) efficient methods for large-scale image processing (c) numerical linear algebra and eigenvalue problems (d) computational hemodynamics.
More details about ongoing projects are listed [here](http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/Research/Area/ScientificComputing/research/). Applicants should indicate their preference among these areas in their research statement.

We particularly encourage women, students from underrepresented groups or institutions, and first-generation college students to apply. 

Applicants should have a strong background in applied mathematics (including numerical linear algebra, differential equations, optimization, ...) as well as technical skills (most importantly, programming skills in MATLAB or Julia). Other optional but highly valued skills include parallel computing, GPU computing, optimization, partial differential equations. In addition to writing a paper, students are expected to produce high-quality codes for their numerical experiments.

Supported participants will receive a stipend of 3,000 USD, travel support of up to 1,000 USD, and free on-campus accommodation.


**Application Materials:**

All applications must be submitted through [mathprograms.org](https://www.mathprograms.org/) by March 8 (direct link will be available shortly)

- Curriculum Vitae
- Research Statement (discussing experiences and skills related to the program, motivation for the program, career goals,...)
- Transcript (unofficial ok)
- Two Reference Letters (to be submitted by the reference writers at this site)

**Eligibility:**

- Students must be enrolled in an undergraduate program at a US institution. US citizenship or permanent residency are not required. 
- Students must be available full-time during the period of June 3 - August  2. 
- The program primarily targets undergraduate students majoring in mathematics or applied mathematics with advanced standing, but we encourage all science majors to apply.
