### Why Scientific Computing?

Scientific computing is at the heart of many cutting-edge technologies and demand for more precise and realistic mathematical simulations is ever growing. Thus computing powers high-impact applications such as precision medicine, medical imaging, network analysis, and machine learning. By obtaining a solid background in scientific computing and applied mathematics, students gain a highly transferable skill set in high demand both in industry and research. See also this excellent [brochure](http://www.siam.org/careers/thinking.php).

### Why Emory?

Emory University is a top-ranked private institution recognized internationally for its outstanding colleges, graduate and professional schools. Emory’s beautiful campus is a part of the active Atlanta metropolitan area, which is home to more than five million people and has a diversity of cultural, social, entertainment, shopping and recreational options.  Atlanta, often referred to as “the City in a Forest”, has mild winters, long and beautiful spring and fall seasons, and is home to the world’s busiest international airport, providing ready access to global travel.

Scientific Computing is one of the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science's focus areas. Our graduate courses are open to all graduate students at Emory especially students enrolled in Mathematics and Computer Science and Informatics graduate programs. Our courses (listed [here](../teaching)) equip our students with in-depth skills in scientific computing and applied mathematics. Our graduate students are also centrally involved in our research projects offering myriad opportunities to develop their own research profiles, present at conferences, and grow their professional networks.  Our graduate students also receive mentorship and training to become independent teachers.

### Funding and Support

Upon admission, Ph.D. students receive stipends and benefits through the [Laney Graduate School](http://www.gs.emory.edu/). The scholarships cover all tuition expenses, include health insurance, and a stipend. The base rate for the stipend is 31,000 USD per year that can be increased by special admission fellowships. 

All Ph.D. students have their own [professional development support funds](http://www.graduateschool.emory.edu/professional-development/pds/index.html) that can be used supplies or travel. Additional support (e.g., conference travel, professional development, summer research) can be provided by the department or their faculty advisor. 
 See the LGS [overview of the financial support](http://www.graduateschool.emory.edu/admissions/finance_overview.html) for more details.

Our program is very international and we welcome applications from international applicants. Successful candidates will have to obtain a US visa and Emory will support applicants in that. See [LGS's overview for international students](http://www.graduateschool.emory.edu/new_students/international.html).

### Graduate Student Life

Emory's graduate student community is diverse with plenty of student organizations and encourages crossing disciplinary boundaries. One organization run by the scientific computing groups' graduate students is Emory's [SIAM student chapter](https://sites.google.com/site/emorysiamchapter/).


### Application Process and Degree Requirements

The [Laney Graduate School](http://www.gs.emory.edu/) accepts applications once a year for admission in the Fall. Application deadlines and detailed information about the application process can be found [here](http://www.gs.emory.edu/admissions/application.html). For additional information related to Scientific Computing, please contact [Jim Nagy](http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~nagy), [Lars Ruthotto](http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~lruthot), [Alessandro Veneziani](http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~ale), or [Yuanzhe Xi](http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~yxi/).


The degree requirements vary by program and are listed [here](http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/site/graduate/degrees/).


### Employment

Upon completing their degree, our graduates are highly competitive and have built successful careers, e.g., as

- postdoc (e.g., UT Austin, Tufts University, University of Maryland, University of Strathclyde)
- faculty (e.g., Virginia Tech, University of West Florida) 
- corporate researcher (e.g., Google, IBM, Intel, Siemens, S&P, Ernst&Young, JP Morgan Chase, Wolfram Research)
- scientists in national laboratories (e.g., Lawrence Livermore, Lawrence Berkeley, Los Alamos, Argonne, Oak Ridge) 

During their studies, our graduate students frequently get invited for summer internships at national labs or companies (e.g., Boeing, Facebook, Google).
