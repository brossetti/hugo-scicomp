Our group has been providing summer research opportunities for undergraduate students for years. Subject to funding availability, we plan to extend these activities and also allow high-school teachers to participate in a research and training program. This website will be updated with more information on projects and positions available for Summer 2020.

## Funding Opportunities

Funding for the summer of 2020 that would allow us to support non-Emory students is still pending and specific details will be published here soon. 

Emory students that are interested in summer research should read about the [**Emory Summer Undergraduate Research Experience (SURE)**](http://college.emory.edu/undergraduate-research/). Applications for the SURE program are reviewed in the spring semester and interested students should identify and talk to a faculty mentor about their project plan ahead of time. The SURE program allows students to work on their project during the summer at the end of which they will present their progress in a poster symposium. Participants receive a stipend and housing support. 




## Past Programs
### Summer 2019

![2019 REU](../img/2019-REU.png)

In the summer of 2019, we hosted a cohort of eight undergraduate students from across the US and Europe. 
The students were advised by Drs. Veneziani, Xi, Nagy, Ruthotto, and Newman. 
We provided some boot camps in the beginning, but the main part was the students exploring and working on three projects. 
Projects were mathematical methods in hemodynamics, efficient estimation methods for log determinants in Gaussian processes, and numerical methods for optimal mass transport. 
The picture above shows this amazing group of students and should convey how much fun we had.
We thank the National Science Foundation and Emory College for providing the financial support to host the students.


### Summer 2018

In the summer of 2018, we hosted a small group of four students from Emory, UC Merced, and U Houston. 
The students were advised by Dr.  Ruthotto and working on new applications of deep neural networks in classification and inverse problems.
This productive summer has led to two Honors theses.
