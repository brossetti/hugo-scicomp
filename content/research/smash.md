This project specifically addresses high-dimensional problems, the use of specialized kernel functions in machine learning, and the high initial computational cost of constructing a hierarchical representation for a kernel matrix. New methods developed will be applied to large-scale cases in a scientific application and a machine learning application: Brownian dynamics and Gaussian process regression. In machine learning, the new methods will complement existing large-scale approaches for Gaussian processes. High-performance software will address specific scaling challenges in constructing hierarchical matrices.
