# EmorySciComp
This repository holds the content for [Emory's Scientific Computing Group Website](http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/Research/Area/ScientificComputing/)

From the content here, the website is generated using [hugo](https://gohugo.io/). 
## Quick overview

The structure of this repository is close the general guidelines of a hugo website. 

1. [static/img](https://github.com/lruthotto/EmorySciComp/tree/master/static/img) holds the image data (please make sure to reduce the file size as much as possible before adding images here)
1. [layouts](https://github.com/lruthotto/EmorySciComp/tree/master/layouts) contains some HTML code to control the general appearance of the site.
1. [contents](https://github.com/lruthotto/EmorySciComp/tree/master/contents) contains markup files that have the actual content in them. This folder is broken down into several subfolders corresponding to the different pages on our website.
1. [archetypes](https://github.com/lruthotto/EmorySciComp/tree/master/archetypes) you probably don't want to edit this.

## How to edit a page?

Let's assume you want to fix a typo, update your name, add a talk, or contribute a description of your new project to the website. All these things happen mostly in the content folder. You have two options to do edits. 

1. Log-in with your github account, navigate in your browser to the file you want to edit and do the changes online. Most likely you will not have push-access to the repository but you should add a pull-request. Your changes will then be merged and updated on the website with some delay.
2. For major changes, it may be best to work locally and do some testing in between. Best way is to fork this repository, clone it to your machine and work on the changes. When you are done, push to your fork and add a pull-request here. 

## Requirements

You will need to use your Github account to do any changes. 

To work and test the website locally, you must have hugo installed.
